Guy: Ready to play some [wait=.3][speed=0.1][shake rate=10 level=15]Chyss[/shake]?
Guy: I promise I won't cheat this time.
- I don't know the rules.
	Guy: [next=.3]Okay so basically, [wait=.5][speed=3]the goal of the game is to win and the only way to do that is by accumulating enough points.
	Guy: [next=.3][speed=3]So starting with the rock (which is obviously the best piece) it does nothing, which is really important sometimes because nothing is everything.
	Guy: [next=.3][speed=3]I found some of these pieces in the boxes of other games, so I'm not quite sure what they do, but I'm sure it doesn't matter.
	Guy: [next=.3][speed=3]I need more words to put in this explaination, and its unlikely anybody's gonna manage to read it so I can kinda do whatever I want.
	Guy: [next=auto]But then this is the complicated part:
	Guy: [next=.3][speed=3]So when you put the pieces in the places they move there and then the other pieces move and the pieces are just an extension of us if you think about it.
	Guy: [next=.3][speed=3]And so like we're really the Chyss pieces and the Chyss pieces are us its so interesting.
	Guy: [next=.3][speed=3]And if you really think about it the whole world is Chyss and nothing is real and the image outside that window is just a flat texture.
	Guy: Got that?
	- No
		Guy: Good.
	- Yeah, I think so.
		Guy: Ur mom
- Okay! Good thing I know how to play.
	Guy: I might cheat.
